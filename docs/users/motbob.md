Motbob, also known as bobbert or the notorious one. Inspired by watching bcs during his mid ages, he chose to finally give up on being a lazy fat man in mom's basement
and become a lawyer. But things weren't easy for this soyboy creature, and out of depression he started watching anime. And even went so far as to start encoding anime
but to his disappointment people started bullying him in seadex for the abysmal quality of his encodes. An enraged and bitter feeling motbob left all public servers,
and decided to create his own heaven, giving it the tagline "no fun allowed", this was the place where he could exercise absolute control over his critics.

Anyway that's the kind of backstory I think motbob had, some of it may be fiction. Now, motbob has always been nice to me, and to write a page on the internet for him
brings me the greatest pleasure, anyways I'll get into some incidents surrounding motbob. The evidence for all of the following exists in discord and im not posting pics currently(many change in future)

# The post reza nyaa account purgings

After reza got snowynix'd, nyaa mods grew absurdly tired of all the shitposting and trolling. Seezing the oppurtunity amidst chaos motbob requested nyaa mods that his
was the most shitposted comment section, and at his behest the mods banned several accounts. Motbob once again showed his intellectual superiority, some theorists even believe that the whole snowynix thing was a ploy by motbob to achieve his own ends, whether that is true or not i'll let the reader decide.

# Banning his mates for framing his as a racist

Sometime, somewhere, i believe zander? yes zander posted a photoshopped screenshot of motbob claiming that reza's releases were always "nigged". And this screenshot was posted again and again on many nyaa comments circulated in many discord servers, until motbob grew tired of it all and banned every seadexer he suspected was involved, and inconnent vodes was also caught in this ban storm. Everyone take a note "motbob is a person of color"


# Unbanning his mates after begna called him an outcast

After areki posted ddy's koe no katachi that begna stalled for like 7 years at qc, begna malded hard. He banned areki. Once again motbob seized the oppurtunity to show his superiority and made a miles better release off of the leaked release, surpassing the official begna release that came a few days after. An enraged begna went on to rant about how motbob is a narcissist and a shitbag and is hence an outcast in the encoding community.Motbob once again did it, and soon unbanned all of his mates and joined seadex proving begna wrong once and for all.

# Baseless Pedo accusations?

Motbob has been called out time and again for allegedly choosing to encode pedo shows like mushoku, onk, onimai. Even begna accused him of only doing popular shows for clout. But to this day all of these claims remain baseless and just utter nuisance for the lack of evidence

# Motbob is a glowie?

Some theorists believe that motbob is a lawyer working for the fbi, his mission is to infiltrate all encoding circles, become a nyaa mod and in due time take down entirety of anime piracy community.

# Motbob use mpc

Unlike the average anime encoder or enjoyer motbob likes to take it rough and not use mpv. He uses mpc-hc instead
