# motbob

This is the story of motbob, who is also known as bobbert or the notorious one in the fansubbing community.During his younger and more vulnerable years he was inspired by watching BCS (in his mid 30s) and decided to give up on being a lazy fat man in his mothers's basement and become a lawyer. Sadly for little bobbert things weren't easy at first,he got bullied at work, got physically assaulted (ehm they actually just patted him on the back but what would a pedo shut-in neet know anything of the outside world) -  he became depressed and started watching anime. In time he got balls deep into the anime community and made a few releases on nyaa but to his disbelief and displeasure, his encodes were heavily criticized by people in seadex, in particular zewia made it to a point to bully him every single time he made a release. Enraged and filled with bitterness motbob left all public discord servers, created his own safe haven in the form of his own server, giving it the tagline "no fun allowed" - this was his territory where he could exercise absolute control over his critics.

That must be the kind of backstory motbob must have had. motbob has always been nice to me, and to write a lore page for him brings me the greatest of pleasures. The evidence for all of the following exists in discord (will post pics in future maybe - maybe)

## The post reza nyaa account purgings

After reza got snowynix'd, nyaa mods grew really tired of all the shitposting and trolling. It is often speculated that -  seizing the opportunity amidst chaos motbob reported to nyaa mods that his was the most shitposted comment section, and at his behest, mods banned several nyaa accounts. By doing this motbob once again showed his intellectual superiority (atleast that's how it was in his own head) , some even believe that the whole snowynix thing was a ploy by motbob to achieve his ends, the veracity of such claims has not been verified as of yet. [motbob himself has denied these claims](https://github.com/snackbxx/thelore/pull/27#issuecomment-1666966783)

## Banning his (play)mates for framing him as a racist

Sometime, somewhere, I believe zander? yes, zander posted an allegedly "photoshopped" screenshot of motbob commenting that reza's releases were always "nigged". This screenshot was posted again and again on many nyaa comment sections and circulated in many discord servers until motbob grew tired of it all and banned every seadexer he suspected was involved from his server,vodes who was innocent was also caught in this ban storm. Everyone take note "motbob is a person of colour"


## Unbanning his (play)mates after begna called him an outcast

After areki released ddy's koe no katachi on nyaa that begna stalled for like 7 years at qc, begna malded hard. He banned areki from ddy discord(totally relevant lore). Once again motbob seized the opportunity to assert his intellectual superiority (or that's how it seemed like in his own head) and made a miles better release off of the leaked release, surpassing the official begna release that came a few days after. Enraged, begna went on to rant calling motbob a narcissist(false imo), a shitbag, and an outcast from the encoding/fansubbing community.
Motbob once again did it, he unbanned all of his mates and joined seadex proving begna wrong once and for all.

## Baseless Pedo accusations?

motbob has been called out time and again for selectively choosing only pedo shows to encode like mushoku, onk, and onimai. Begna accused him of only doing popular shows for clout. But to this day all of these claims remain baseless and just utter nuisance due to the sheer lack of evidence.

## motbob is a glowie?

Some believe that motbob is a lawyer working for the fbi, his mission is to infiltrate all encoding circles and private trackers, become highly trusted in these communities and in due time take down the entirety of anime piracy community.

## motbob uses mpc

Unlike the average anime encoder or enjoyer motbob likes to take it rough and not use mpv. He uses mpc-hc instead

## motbob doesn't own an OLED
yup
