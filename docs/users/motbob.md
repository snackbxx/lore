Motbob, also known as bobbert or the notorious one. Inspired by watching bcs during his mid ages, he chose to finally give up on being a lazy fat man in mom's basement
and become a lawyer. But things weren't easy for this soyboy creature, and out of depression he started watching anime. And even went so far as to start encoding anime
but to his disappointment people started bullying him in seadex for the abysmal quality of his encodes. An enraged and bitter feeling motbob left all public servers,
and decided to create his own heaven, giving it the tagline "no fun allowed", this was the place where he could exercise absolute control over his critics.

Anyway that's the kind of backstory I think motbob had, some of it may be fiction. Now, motbob has always been nice to me, and to write a page on the internet for him
brings me the greatest pleasure, anyways I'll get into some incidents surrounding motbob.
