# motbob

Motbob, also known as bobbert or the notorious one in the fansubbing community.He was inspired by watching BCS during his mid 30s, and finally chose to give up on being a lazy fat man in his mom's basement and become a lawyer. Sadly for little bobbert things weren't easy at first, he became depressed and started watching anime. In time he started encoding anime but to his disbelief and displeasure, his encodes people in seadex criticized his abysmal work. Enraged and filled with bitterness motbob left all public servers, created his personal own haven in the form of a discord server, giving it the tagline "no fun allowed", this was his territory where he could exercise absolute control over his critics.

That must be the kind of backstory motbob must have had. Motbob has always been nice to me, and to write a page on the internet for him brings me the greatest pleasure. The evidence for all of the following exists in discord (will post pics in future maybe)

## The post reza nyaa account purgings

After reza got snowynix'd, nyaa mods grew absurdly tired of all the shitposting and trolling. It is often speculated that seizing the opportunity amidst chaos motbob reported nyaa mods that his was the most shitposted comment section, and at his behest, mods banned several nyaa accounts. By doing this motbob once again showed his intellectual superiority, some theorists even believe that the whole snowynix thing was a ploy by motbob to achieve his ends, whether that is true or not I'll let the reader decide. [Motbob himself has denied these claims](https://github.com/snackbxx/thelore/pull/27#issuecomment-1666966783)

## Banning his mates for framing him as a racist

Sometime, somewhere, I believe zander? yes, zander posted a photoshopped screenshot of motbob commenting that reza's releases were always "nigged". This screenshot was posted again and again on many nyaa comment sections and circulated in many discord servers until motbob grew tired of it all and banned every seadexer he suspected was involved from his server, an innocent vodes was also caught in this ban storm. Everyone should take note "motbob is a person of colour"


## Unbanning his mates after begna called him an outcast

After areki posted ddy's koe no katachi that begna stalled for like 7 years at qc, begna malded hard. He banned areki from ddy discord(totally relevant lore). Once again motbob seized the opportunity to assert his intellectual superiority and made a miles better release off of the leaked release, surpassing the official begna release that came a few days after. Enraged, begna went on to rant about how motbob is a narcissist(false imo) and a shitbag and is hence an outcast from the encoding/fansubbing community.
Motbob once again did it, he unbanned all of his mates and joined seadex proving begna wrong once and for all.

## Baseless Pedo accusations?

Motbob has been called out time and again for allegedly choosing to encode pedo shows like mushoku, onk, and onimai. Begna accused him of only doing popular shows for clout. But to this day all of these claims remain baseless and just utter nuisance due to the lack of evidence

## Motbob is a glowie?

Some theorists believe that motbob is a lawyer working for the fbi, his mission is to infiltrate all encoding circles and private trackers, become highly trusted in these communities and in due time take down the entirety of anime piracy community.

## Motbob uses mpc

Unlike the average anime encoder or enjoyer motbob likes to take it rough and not use mpv. He uses mpc-hc instead
