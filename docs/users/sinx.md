# Sinx

## Before the Ban

Sinx used to be your average regular on Snackbox, he was a notorius streetshitter who would do a little trolling whenever the opportunity presented itself. It stayed that way until...

## The Ban

While it isn't known excatly what the message was that caused the ban, from what is known, Sinx insulted the staff member munch and spammed several hard-r's. In response to this, munch proceeded to hand him a permanent ban.

## Afterwards

After this happened, Sinx would stay in SeaDex for about a week, eventually leaving, this would appear to be the end for him. However, on November 18th, 2022, SXX would unban every banned person, including Sinx, Sinx would then rejoin the server and engage in conversation. Soon after though, SInx and most other banned users were re-banned, presumably by another staff member.

## The End?

After this, Sinx was really only active in people's direct messages, so we don't know exactly what happened, but on March 12, 2023, the user Bob the Builder got a dm from Sinx, since dm leaking is big scary and evil, the full dm can't be shown, but in the messsage, Sinx basically said that he was done with private trackers and that he was planning for his own death, presumably through suicide.

After that dm, he didn't reply to any direct messages nor spoke on any servers. As Sinx's location and real name weren't known, we couldn't check to see if he really had died, and thus, most people on Snackbox, SeaDex, and other assorted servers were convinced that he had actually died, even making several jokes about it.

However, soon enough, Bob the Builder got a new dm from a random alt, in it, Sinx admitted that he had lied about killing himself for some reason. Since then, Sinx was alone wolf, he was spotted on other tracker/fansub discord servers, but he never rejoined Snackbox, for his ban appeal had never been accepted, that was, at least, until August 04, 2023.

## The Restart

On August 04, 2023, SXX, the head moderator of Snackbox, did something he called an "Annual Amnesty", as can be implied from the name, this was a mass unban of every banned server member, which, of course, included Sinx. About an hour after the Annual Amnesty, Sinx rejoined and sent his first message in over half a year, and he has since remained on the server, which he presumably still will unless he gets banned again or leaves, but that definitely won't happen again haha.
