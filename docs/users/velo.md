## Velo Spending Habits

Velo's letter to his dad asking for money.
>Dear Dad,
>Here is the information you requested. Note that I take no pleasure spending your money on these, and would much rather have a proper job or at least an income source.
>
>1. €2,99/month - Amazon Prime
>2. €12,99/month - Nerdvenger Prime tier channel membership (will stop in two months once I get the Platinum badge; The Den Of Nerds Live is a channel whose content I love, but there IS a cheaper membership tier; for further reference, contact me during your office hours, away from my Grinch of a mother)
>3. €5,99/month - Pekora Ch. membership (Usada Pekora is a V-Tuber; don't question it, just go with it)
>4. €13,99/month - Deezer Premium (I don't really use this, and I believe this is the first renewal, and I plan on cancelling it ASAP)
>5. €4,99 - Plex Pass (if you want to know what Plex is I'll explain it to you later)
>6. €95,99/year - Skillshare (actually useful for a lot of stuff including Python, Dutch, music, etc.; I had a free trial via [redacted], so this is the first billing, and I can get free months by referring friends pretty much)
>7. €5,99/year - Oniri (dream journal and lucid dreaming app; yes that's 6 for a whole YEAR)
>8. €7,49/year - Notability (non-negotiable; Notability is my primary notetaking app on iPad, and >can seamlessly sync with my iPhone and even my Realme XT or a Mac if I ever buy one; subscription is for advanced math OCR and other features I regularly use while taking notes)
>9. €12,49/year - Halide Mk. II (camera app that allows me to take uncompressed RAW photographs and other cool stuff, since can't shoot in ProRes or ProRAW on the Mini iPhones; renews in February 2023, so don't even consider it part of the budget)
>10. €19,95 - Apple One - Family (bundles a bunch of Apple subscriptions for way cheaper than all of them individually; individual Apple One isn't much safer, and Family Sharing can be really useful in the near OR distant future, both for our family and any potential significant other of mine)
>11. €9,99/month iCloud+ - 2 TB space on iCloud so that I never run into issues again. Additive, so even if I cancel Apple One I'll still have 2 TB, and including the storage that's part of the Apple One bundle I get 2,2 TB
>12. €9,99/month - Google One (need to get rid of this one eventually)
>13. €8,99/month - Bunq’s stupidity (maaro inko bc!)
>14. €4,99/month - Mullvad VPN
>15. €5,99/month - With the Will Digimon Forums Patreon (need to cancel this; no real benefit + patron channel on their Discord pretty much dead)
>16. €14,99/month - Curve Metal (for that amazing MasterCard that gives me a bunch of neat features)
>17. €8,99/month - Disney+ (I wanna get yearly, which is like €89,99 a year, before they hike prices; jhanjhat khatam bc; I will never NOT need Disney+)
>18. €4,99/month - ProtonMail (baad mein call karna, I’ll explain)
>19. €9,99/month - Revolut Premium
>20. €3,99/month - Last.fm Pro (haan samajh gaya, bahut saare subscriptions hain, ab aap officially joota faink ke maar saktein hain)
>21. €56/month - Tele2 (phone + SIM bill, will actually pay off device costs in one go once I start working as a TA, so SIM only costs will be €27 a month)
>22. Variable costs + €5,99 a month - NS Flex (the OV-Chipkaart)
>23. €6,99/month - YouTube Premium (this is with student pricing btw)
>24. €9,99/month - PornHub Premium (I don't even wanna hear what you're gonna say; prematurely shut up)
>25. ~€140/year - seedbox (this is going to change, as in get less because my provider is making changes to their plans; also, [friend] from [place] is paying half of the costs, since he shares this seedbox with me; Mom is the intermediary/escrow in this case, but don't say anything filhaal ke liye)
>26. ₹163/month - Netflix (paid by Mom; yes, that's rupees)
>27. €4,99/month - Spotify Premium Student
>28. €7,50/month but not every month (I deny the direct debit request sometimes) - Hulphond (a charity focused on training therapy dogs for kids with epilepsy)
>29. Infrequently €9,99/month - ON THAT ASS (a subscription service for UNDERWEAR)
>30. €0,60/month(?) - something ABN AMRO (yeh log bhi madarchod hain)
>
>Please season your gaalis away from the kitchen; I cannot have Mom or my easily angered brother seeing this email. Thanks 🙏🏻
>
>Kind regards and sincere shame + helplessness,
>[my irl name]
