# JizzPlex

Jizzplex is a tight-knit, semi-exclusive Plex server hosted and operated by Mizz141, a well-known member of the SnackBox and previous r/ap server.  In order to get in, Mizz must invite you and he is generally selective with who she chooses to invite.  If you are an active user in SnackBox and chill you fit most of the Jizzplex criteria.  Mizz may choose to invite you or not, you might also find an invite hidden in his messages or elsewhere.

The Plex server has some metadata in German.  American movies use German titles and metadata but usually contain English audio at least.  There is a large amount of anime on the server and any member can request any anime be added to it via a bot.  The anime is always subtitled in English usually, although some may contain German metadata.  

Overall the Plex server is well regarded and a staple in r/ap and SnackBox lore.  It is fast, snappy, and has a lot of content.  The server also contains several guides for new Plex users.

## Members
