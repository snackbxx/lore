# BodyPartDex

Something that started out as a joke by members of the r/animepiracy discord server due to many members sending pictures of their limbs to confirm to other members that they weren't "Indian". As the standard belief shared among server members was that everyone was "Indian till proven otherwise".

The project in its current state can be found over at [https://bodypartdex.vercel.app](https://bodypartdex.vercel.app) and was made by tsuki and Nagi, who are members of SnackBox.
