# What is the Bookworm mafia?

It's a group of two, sometimes three, people who discuss the pre-publication releases of the hit isekai light-novel series, "Ascendance of a Bookworm".
The group's also described as cult due to their feverent love for the series and the various religious references in the plot of the series itself.

# Who's involved in this cult?

- bankai_phonk#3135
- Genesiss#0125
- vibe

Other (possible) members who've only started to be indoctrinated include:
- ankh#8694
- guyman#4884
- Nish#6661
- scourgeofgrozny#8050

# How much do they like the series?

### Enough to rival leaked Snowden documents

### Enough for it to still be the no. 1 priority while having a mental breakdown

### Enough to come up with an alternate persona on Nyaa

### Enough to make up fan-fiction about who the mysterious [Kinoworm] could be

# So should I start Bookworm?

It depends. It definitely isn't for everyone, and the start is a little slow, but the members of the mafia are insistent that if you manage
to stick with then you won't be disappointed.

In later parts and volumes the series takes a detour from it's established setting and starts to combine more and more tropes from the genre together,
in a way where it isn't boring or predictable. One member in particular likened the later parts to a mix between Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and
a lot of unexpectedly political plotlines.

So we would urge each of you to give it a try, specifically with the [Kinoworm] release on a specific cat website.
