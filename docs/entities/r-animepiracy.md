# r/animepiracy

[r/animepiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy) is a reddit community dedicated to the discussion of piracy surrounding anime, manga, manhwa, light novels, visual novels, and hentai. It also had a corresponding Discord Community, which no longer exists.

## Info

The original SnackBox server before its deletion was known as r/ap, AKA r/animepiracy.  It was often shortened to r/ap and as the name implies it was created originally as a Discord hub for the animepiracy subreddit.  It's community however was often regarded as vastly different than the typical r/animepiracy subreddit user and was host to mainy regular active users and shitposters.  One day without warning r/ap's discord server was taken down by Discord, it was not specifically targeted but rather was apart of a long list of piracy related servers that got taken down on that fateful day.

## Legacy

The shutdown was sudden and brutal.  Tons of content, posts, memes, and users were lost and the mod team knew it would be crucial to start rebuilding as soon as possible in order to keep the server alive.  All the active users migrated, the banned userlist was reset, and for a while the successor wasn't public.  Only SeaDex users knew about the new server for a while and it wasn't even originally called SnackBox, it cycled through several names.  The r/animepiracy and r/ap name were dropped in order to avoid the Discord server getting caught in another ban wave.  After implementing strict new rules and auto moderation (including auto removing words like 'piracy' and 'old server') the server staff was satisfied with these safeguards and eventually re-opened the server on the anime piracy subreddit.

The original r/ap server was legendary, it was the genesis of the culture and shitposting you see today in SnackBox and many parts of the lore originate there.  Hopefully for users who never had the chance to use the old server this post serves as a thorough enough overview.
