# Perfect Dark

## Before the Incident

PD, short for Perfect Dark, is a Japanese semi-private site, it's notable for containing some not-so-legal materials (aka: cp), even aside from normal piracy. On Snackbox, there are two confirmed members of PD (though there are probably others we don't know), those being ankh and Bob, Bob would post stories and images of PD, usually schizoing them with his anti-logger skills. Ankh only recently joined PD, but has done some streams of him browsing it before.

## The Cause of the Incident

As a sort of joke (and for advertising purposes), Bob, and later ankh, would post some SeaDex releases to PD, including the Snackbox discord link aswell, no one really expected someone from PD to join, since it's not like they'd know what would be on there considering the usual PD content. Considering the largely Japanese userbase of PD, even if someone did join, they probably wouldn't understand the server and would leave, there seemed to be no chance that someone from PD would click Bob or ankh's link to the server.

## The Incident

After a rather lengthy discussion about Mudae, a new user joined the server, their name being 'SaiyajinVegeta3', as normal, the Snackbox members immediately started talked about this person being an alt.

While everyone was talking, SaiyajinVegeta3 posted something rather shocking to the Snackbox members.

The reactions were immediate, PD was well known on Snackbox, and considering the "advertising" that ankh and Bob had done, it was clear to see what had happened, someone from PD (a place with cp on it) had clicked either Bob or ankh's links to the server.

## Aftermath

As shown in the screenshots above, this was a sizable event, while Bob and ankh had stopped advertising the day prior, a PD member had gotten on to the server, this was a first for Snackbox. Though one may wonder what SaiyajinVegeta3 wanted to download from PD, when asked by Bob in a dm, he didn't respond immediately, giving people worry over what he could've been trying to download.

It would turn out that he was just trying to download One Piece dvds.

It was recognized that this was the guy from a screenshot posted a few days before containing a guy asking for the exact same thing on PD.

After the first draft of this article came out, SaiyajinVegeta3 had something to announce...
