# Lurker

It was a normal day on Snackbox, when suddenly there was an announcement.

The trackers channel was now limited to ranks 3 and higher. This wasn't that big a deal to most, since ranking up to level 3 only took about 800-1,000 messages, which most people, especially those that were active, were able to reach in less than a week. It wasn't that big of a deal, most people that were actually active were rank 3 or up, so this didn't really mean much.

## The Event

It all started when a few low-ranked people came in to general after the announcement. (someone else do the rest, or I'l do it after waking up)

## Notes

accounts now require lvl 3
several ptg losers lose access
ptg in shambles
