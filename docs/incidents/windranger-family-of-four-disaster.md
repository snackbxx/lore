# Windranger family of four disaster

## Introduction

Franny, a male-to-female transgender individual, had a deep interest in motorcycles and was an avid enthusiast of the popular Final Fantasy video game series. She was known to discuss personal topics, including her hypersexuality, with anybody that breathed.

## The Incident

On July 14, 2022, a tragic incident occurred on what coincidentally happened to be Franny's birthday. While out celebrating, Franny was allegedly involved in a fatal collision. Operating her motorcycle at a speed significantly exceeding the posted limit, she collided with a family of four who were crossing the road. The devastating collision resulted in the immediate loss of all four family members.

## The Aftermath

In the aftermath of the accident, Franny faced legal consequences. She was charged with four counts of manslaughter for her role in the tragedy. However, due to a legal technicality in her state, she managed to avoid incarceration. This outcome sparked debate within the server regarding the effectiveness of the legal system and its ability to deliver justice, particularly in respect to minority groups.

Franny has since chosen to pretend that the tragic incident never occurred, further deepening the emotional wounds left by the accident. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible behavior on the road and the profound impact of such events on the lives of those involved.
