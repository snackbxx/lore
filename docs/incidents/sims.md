# Sims

## Warning

This article is based on events that happened in the old r/ap Discord server.  Information may be inaccurate, incomplete, or completely wrong. There is no way to verify anything. You have been warned. This article uses several accounts of what people said happened, and when possible, images to back up statements if any were saved.

## Incident Info

A user named JadeHawk joins the r/ap server and has his first post in the Technology channel.  He explains that he needs help with a Sim 4 mod. He goes on to further state how EA has been cracking down on Sim mods. This was a strange thing to say as EA has official mods for the game. It soon became clear though when he said he would get banned for the mod. A random user searched for banned Sim mods and suddenly they found that there was one popular one that was used to allow the player to have sex with any entity (including animals and children). It turns out that EA was actively banning these degenerate fucks and he unknowingly gave that away. After being confronted he admitted that he was interested in the mod.
