## Introduction

The Snackbox Iceberg is an iceberg image made by Gen. On this page, we will go over each entry and hopefully provide a thorough explanation for each one.

## 1st Layer

## "I fucking love this scene"

Gen (yes, the person who made the iceberg) is a big fan of the anime "March Comes In like a Lion", and he was a big fan of one scene in particular. So, to show his appreciation towards the scene, he decided to post the scene on the discord server with the phrase "fucking love this scene", this would've been fine normally, but the scene begins with this:

The scene is actually fairly innocent, but when the scene starts with that line, you can imagine that some people would find it very funny, and this screenshot would be constantly reposted on the server, and everytime it was posted, it would easily get many star and joy reacts.

Gen would go on to take advantage of this meme, and every now and then, he'll reference this infamous post, to the joy of many Snackbox users.

## SXX pinging @everyone

The owner of Snackbox, SXX, likes to do @everyone pings, like a lot. Normally, you use them for updates, announcements, or for general news. But SXX uses them far more liberally, if the chat's looking too dead, he'll do a ping; if he wants people to join him on Minecraft, he'll do a ping; he'll even do one just because it'd be funny too. Needless to say, this has annoyed countless members of the server, mostly lurkers.

## OLED

This entry is most likely about Snackbox moderator Legionaire. Now Legion likes OLED, he _really_ likes OLED. If he sees someone with an SDR screen, he'll tell them to get an OLED one. Sometimes he'll just randomly start talking about how much he loves OLED even when no one mentioned it. He even managed to get several people to join him in praising OLED, like fellow staff member RainingTerror.

## #trackers level requirement

Now, before we begin, we need to talk about PTG. What is PTG, you ask? While, it refers to a reoccuring thread on 4chan's /g/ board, dedicated to private trackers. Due to its focus on piracy, Snackbox and PTG have always been kind of co-linked, the link to our Discord server even being included in the thread opener for a few months.

#trackers is a channel on Snackbox dedicated to the discussion of public and private torrent trackers. As this was arguably one of the more popular places to discuss trackers, many PTG users and general private tracker enjoying people made Discord accounts so they could lurk the trackers channel.

Then, one day, an incident occured, one that is gone into with a bit more depth on the Lurker Incident [page](https://lore.snackbox.moe/incidents/lurker). But basically, there was now a requirement to view #trackers, you needed to be rank 3 or higher, which took sending hundreds of messages on the server. Something most of the active Snackbox members had already done, but the lurkers? Most of them had never even sent a message, and at this news, they flooded the general channel, some to complain, some to begin the grind, and some to meme.

Most Snackbox users were shocked at the revelaton of just how many people lurked the trackers channel, be it from following the Discord link on PTG, or just going from The Index and liking that channel best, there were dozens of people.

But no matter the case, the level requirement stayed, and it was even raised to ranks 5 and above later, though this was met with barely any complaint, as most of the prior lurkers had either left, never talked again, or grinded to above that.
